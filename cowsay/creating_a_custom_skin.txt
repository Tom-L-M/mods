Small tutorial on creating and using a custom skin:

1. Get an ascii art (or whatever you want)

2. Place the following text fields in proper places on the ascii art:
    {$balloon}          - Where the balloon will be placed *
    {$tl}               - A "\\" char (balloon connector on the left-side)
    {$tr}               - A "/" char (balloon connector on the right-side)
    {$eye1}             - The left eye char
    {$eye2}             - The right eye char
    {$tongue}           - The tongue char

   The only mandatory field is the $balloon, the rest is actually optional.
   But placing the rest allows for changing the eyes and tongue style with 
   the style modifiers (stoned, dead, borg, ...), which is very nice.

3. Call the program in command line with the '-f' flag and the path to the 
   custom skin.

4. Enjoy!


* If the balloon field is placed in a way that is not in column zero
of some line, it will not be displayed properly aligned.
